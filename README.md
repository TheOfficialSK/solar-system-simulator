Orbital-Simulation is a Java-based solar system simulation (using Processing to run) that allows you to visualize and interact with various celestial objects in a dynamic, 2D environment. This project features a customizable model of the solar system, including planets, moons, and satellites, and allows users to experiment with different orbital parameters and observe their effects on the overall system.

## Features:

Customizable solar system model, including celestial objects like planets, moons, and satellites
Two predefined scenes to explore, with different shapes, colors, and orbits for each celestial object
Adjustable speed modifier for speeding up or slowing down the simulation
Toggleable background clearing to observe orbit paths more clearly
Utilizes ```Java AWT``` and ```Matrix libraries``` for easy integration with other Java projects

## Getting Started:

Clone the repository.
Open the ```orbit.pde``` file in your preferred processing supporting IDE.
Switch between the two predefined scenes by commenting/uncommenting the ```setupScene1()``` and ```setupScene2()``` calls in the ```setup()``` function.
Adjust the ```speedModifier``` variable to change the simulation speed.
Set the ```clearBackground``` variable to false if you want to see the orbital paths.
Run the project and watch the solar system simulation unfold!
